Football Cards Project
Overview
This project displays a collection of football player cards built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases how to dynamically manipulate the DOM, handle events, and filter data using modern JavaScript techniques. Additionally, the project reinforces key concepts like object destructuring, default parameters, and the use of Object.freeze() for immutable data.

Features
Dynamic Card Creation: Football player data is rendered dynamically using DOM manipulation.
Filtering: Easily filter cards based on specific player attributes.
Event Handling: Interactive events allow for dynamic updates and actions on the cards.
Data Protection: Used Object.freeze() to ensure the immutability of the football player data.
Key Concepts Covered
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updating and interacting with HTML elements.
Object Destructuring: Simplifies working with object properties.
Default Parameters: Ensures functions have fallback values.
Event Handling: Responds to user actions such as clicks and inputs.
Data Filtering: Filters and displays specific players based on criteria.
Switch Statement: Handles multiple conditions efficiently.
map() Method: Transforms arrays and renders data dynamically.
Technologies Used
